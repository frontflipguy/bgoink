  	<LIB>Dear dad, I hope you're having a FLAGOINK day. I'm writing to tell you about my coding project. It's going FLAGOINK and I have to FLAGOINK really hard to get it to work sometimes.
    Anyway, thanks for giving me good genetics, as your son I'm especially thankful for my FLAGOINK. Love, Bradley</LIB>
